Within this pen the java script takes the form input and calculates what has been entered into the form,  converts into an object with the property names coming from the input id an values from each input. It then logs it to the console with workings on daily spend based on the number of days until next payday.


Things I will look to be doing here is to output the entries to screen rather than in the console log.
